## Magic System Overview

### Current System

Magic in BloodBond is a verbal-based system where spellcasters create incantations by combining syllables into words. The system has these key characteristics:

- **Verbal Casting**: Magic requires vocalizing specific syllables in sequence
- **Element-Based**: Spells are tied to one of nine primary elements (Moon, Wind, Water, Fire, Earth, Death, Protection, Love, Song) plus Sun
- **Bloodline Compatibility**: A character's godly bloodline determines their natural affinity for certain elements
- **Spell Level System**: Spells have power levels that determine their effectiveness
- **Magical Affinity**: Character's magical ability adds to spell effectiveness
- **Godly Blessing Percentage**: Divine heritage provides additional spell power
- **Cast Time**: Most spells have a standard cast time with some variations based on complexity

### Potential Features

1. **Magic System Guide**: An interactive tutorial explaining the BloodBond magic system
2. **Bloodline Compatibility Calculator**: Tool to determine spell compatibility based on character bloodline
3. **Spell Point Calculator**: Track and calculate SP costs and availability during gameplay
4. **Cast Time Visualizer**: Visual representation of cast times for different spell types

### Implementation Priority

## Spell Formula & Damage Calculations

### Current System
BloodBond uses a detailed formula system for calculating spell effects:

- **Spell Damage Formula**: `Damage = (Class Die × Spell Level) + Magical Affinity + Godly Blessing Percentage`
  - Class Die: Determined by character class (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12)
  - Spell Level: Power level of the spell
  - Magical Affinity: Character's magical ability modifier
  - Godly Blessing Percentage: Bonus from divine heritage

- **Range Categories**:
  - Self: Affects only the caster
  - Touch: Must physically touch the target
  - Short: 30ft range
  - Medium: 60ft range
  - Long: 120ft range
  - Extreme: 240ft range

- **Duration Categories**:
  - Instantaneous: Effect occurs immediately with no duration
  - 1 round: Lasts until the caster's next turn
  - Short: 1 minute (10 rounds)
  - Medium: 10 minutes
  - Long: 1 hour
  - Extended: 8 hours
  - Day-long: 24 hours

- **Spell Casting Difficulty**:
  - Based on spell complexity, element compatibility, and environmental factors
  - Modified by character's magical affinity and godly blessing

### Potential Features

1. **Damage Calculator**: Calculate and display spell damage based on element, power level, and modifiers
2. **Range & Duration Calculator**: Automatically calculate spell range and duration based on power level
3. **SP Cost Optimizer**: Suggest optimal spell power levels based on available SP and desired effects

## Spell Composition

### Current System
Spells in BloodBond are created by combining syllables into words, with each syllable representing an element, action, or modifier:

- **Syllable-Based System**: Incantations use specific syllables to invoke magical effects
- **Syntax Structure**: Element + Action + Target/Modifier
- **Core Element Syllables**:
  - **MOON** (Lu): Illusion, dreams, madness
  - **WIND** (Vel): Air, movement, freedom
  - **WATER** (Aqu): Fluidity, healing, emotion
  - **FIRE** (Ig): Destruction, passion, transformation
  - **EARTH** (Ter): Stability, strength, growth
  - **DEATH** (Mort): Ending, decay, transition
  - **PROTECTION** (Shel): Defense, preservation, barriers
  - **LOVE** (Amo): Connection, empathy, control
  - **SONG** (Can): Harmony, inspiration, manipulation
  - **SUN** (Sol): Light, truth, purification

- **Action Syllables**: Determine what the spell does (e.g., "Bril" for light, "Dal" for damage, "Mov" for movement)
- **Target/Modifier Syllables**: Specify targets, duration, range, or special effects
- **Examples**:
  - "Ig-Dal-Mas" = Fire Damage Enhanced
  - "Aqu-Heal-Sel" = Water Healing Self

## Advanced Spellcasting

### Current System
BloodBond includes several advanced spellcasting techniques:

- **Particasts (Ambient Magic)**: Low-effort, subtle magic that draws on ambient magical energy
  - Less powerful than formal spells but can be cast quickly and discreetly
  - Does not require formal incantation, just focused intent and minimal gestures
  - Used for minor effects like lighting a candle or cooling a drink
  - Limited by the caster's affinity with the element being manipulated

- **Uncapped Spells**: Special spells that have no upper limit to their potential power
  - Associated with "The Fool" aspect of Oracle magic
  - Extremely dangerous and unpredictable
  - Draw power directly from godly sources rather than the caster
  - Can potentially exceed the caster's normal capabilities
  - Risk of magical backlash or loss of control increases with power level

- **Elemental Fusion**: Combining two compatible elements to create unique magical effects
  - Requires proficiency in both elements being combined
  - Creates effects that neither element could produce alone
  - Difficulty based on the compatibility between the elements
  - Examples: Fire + Earth = Magma, Water + Wind = Ice/Steam

- **Ritual Casting**: Extended spellcasting involving multiple participants or components
  - Significantly more powerful than standard spells
  - Requires preparation, specialized components, and longer casting time
  - Can achieve effects impossible for individual casters
  - Often tied to celestial events or sacred locations

### Potential Features

1. **Particast Calculator**: Calculate reduced costs and effects for partial casting
2. **Channeling Tracker**: Track channeled spells across multiple rounds
3. **Uncapped Spell Calculator**: Calculate effects and costs for spells beyond Master level
4. **Spell Merger**: Tool to combine compatible spells and calculate the resulting effects
