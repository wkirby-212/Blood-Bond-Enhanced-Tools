# World & Timekeeping

### The Wheel of the Year
::
*Blood Bond* follows a circular calendar system known as **The Wheel of the Year**. This cyclical passage of time dictates the seasons, festivals, and rituals observed by the various cultures and races within the world. The changing of the seasons is not merely a weather-based phenomenon but is deeply tied to magical and divine influences.
::
Throughout the year, the transitions between seasons are marked by grand feasts, rituals, and significant cultural events that vary depending on the race or society celebrating them. The solstices and equinoxes hold special meaning, often serving as times of renewal, transition, or divine intervention.
::
Different races and civilizations have unique ways of tracking time and commemorating the passing of the year. Some cultures follow **lunar cycles**, while others base their timekeeping on **celestial events** or the **position of constellations** sacred to their gods.
::
Notably, some ancient societies believe the *Wheel of the Year* is connected to **fate itself**—those born on specific celestial alignments may be **blessed or cursed** based on the position of the stars. Such beliefs shape traditions of prophecy and divine interpretation, making time a crucial aspect of both everyday life and grand cosmic storytelling.

To begin with character creation, you first roll 8d6 twice and record each set of numbers seperately then you pick one set of 8d6 that you would prefer to keep. set these aside, and they will then be applied later during the character creation process to your skills which are listed below in detail.

In character creation player rolls 8d6 twice resulting in two sets of numbers:
- 8d6 (4, 5, 6, 4, 3, 6, 6, 6)

- **Blessing:** Moon-linked spells deal **100% extra damage**.
- **Resistance:** Increased resistance to **moon-related magic**.

---

### **Step 5: Choose Your Starting Equipment**

**Reference:** *Check the Blood Bond Weapons and Armour Documents.*

**Example Equipment:**
- **Weapons:** Brass Knuckles (*Unarmed combat*)
- **Armor:** None (*Relies on Agility-based evasion*)
- **Special Items:**
  - Meditation Beads (*Martial Artist Item*)

  - Traveler’s Clothes (*Background Item*)
  - 12 Days of Rations
  - 15 Gold

### **Step 6: Assign Skill Levels**
Skills define **success in ability checks** and are influenced by **race, career, and background**.

**Reference:** *Check the Blood Bond Skills page for the full skill list.*

**Example Allocation:**
| **Skill** | **Base** | **Modifiers** | **Final Level** |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Flexibility** | 8 | (Martial Artist) | **8** |
| **Sleight of Hand** | 6 | (Martial Artist) | **6** |
| **Aim** | 6 | (Martial Artist) | **6** |
| **Grip** | 5 | (Martial Artist) | **5** |
| **Adaptation** | 4 | +1 (Background) | **5** |
| **Recovery** | 3 | (Martial Artist) | **3** |
| **Speed** | 2 | +1 (Background) | **3** |
| **Gossip** | 1 | (Background) | **1** |

---

### **Step 7: Calculate Your Combat Stats**
#### **Evasion (Armor Class)**
**Formula:** `Agility × 5 + Armor Bonus`  
**Calculation:** `(8 × 5) + 0 = 40 Evasion`

#### **Speed**
**Formula:** Based on **Speed Level** (*Check the Blood Bond Speed Document*).  
**Calculation:** **Speed Level 8 = 45ft movement per turn**

#### **HP Calculation**
**Formula:** `Class Dice + Immunity per level`  
**Calculation:** `d12 (Martial Artist) + Immunity (4) = 12 HP at Level 1`

#### **Attack Rolls**
**Formula:** `Weapon Damage Dice × Rank + Strength/Agility Bonus`  
**Calculation:** `Brass Knuckles (1d12) × Rank 1 = 1d12 damage`

---

### **Step 8: Personalize Your Character**
Now, flesh out your character’s **backstory, personality, and goals**.

**Example Backstory:**
- **Where did they grow up?**  
  *Kaelen was born in an Aelvis sky-city, where he mastered aerial movement and hand-to-hand combat from a young age.*
- **Why did they choose their career?**  
  *A run-in with underground martial artists opened his eyes to a new form of fighting—one that relied on momentum and precision rather than brute force.*
- **What are their ambitions?**  
  *To prove his martial techniques against the greatest warriors, and to reclaim the lost Aelvis fighting traditions.*
- **What’s their relationship with their godly link?**  
  *Kaelen believes his agility and insight are gifts from the Moon Goddess, pushing him toward his destiny.*
- **Do they have any weaknesses in combat?**  
  *Kaelen's fragile bones make him highly vulnerable to heavy strikes, especially bludgeoning attacks.*

---

### **Final Character Summary**
#### **Kaelen Swiftwing**
**Aelvis (Skyborne) | Martial Artist (Aikido) | Linked to the Moon Goddess**  
*A master of evasion, precision strikes, and counterattacks, Kaelen seeks to test his skills against the world's finest warriors.*

#### **Key Stats:**
- **Evasion:** 40
- **Speed:** 45ft
- **HP:** 12
- **Primary Weapon:** Brass Knuckles (1d4 damage)

# Combat System
## Combat Rules - Tactical Roleplay

# Combat Mechanics
:
The **Blood Bond Combat System** is designed to merge tactical depth with roleplay-heavy combat. It emphasizes coordination, fluid initiative, and strategic decision-making over traditional turn-based mechanics.
}}

:: 

## Combat Mechanics

### Turn Order & Action Economy
- **Two Turn Phases**: Players act first, followed by enemies.
- **Player Collaboration**: Instead of strict initiative, players coordinate their actions dynamically.
- **Enemy Speed Interference**: Certain foes can disrupt turn order due to their high-speed abilities.

---

## Attack & Defence

### Weapons & Damage Calculation
Each class has a **specific damage die**, and total weapon damage is calculated as follows:

> **Damage = (Class Die × Weapon Rank) + Relevant Stat Modifier**
{{note
**Example**:  
A **Farmer** (*d10 class die*) wielding a **Rank 5 Bastard Sword** with **Strength 7** deals: (5d10) + 7 damage
}}

### Evasion-Based Defense
Armor determines **Evasion** instead of traditional AC.

> **Evasion = 5 × Agility Level** + armor bonuses.

| Armor Type  | Bonus Evasion | Strength Requirement |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Light Armor  | +15          | None                |
| Medium Armor | +25          | Strength 6+         |
| Heavy Armor  | +35          | Strength 8+         |

**Blind Spot Attacks**:  
- If attacked from **behind or the side**, the target **loses 20 Evasion** and cannot make opportunity attacks.

---

### Fighting Spirit (Morale System)
- Enemies have a **Fighting Spirit** stat (1-100).
- Players can roleplay or roll **d20** at the end of each round to lower enemy morale.
- If the roll exceeds the enemy’s Fighting Spirit, they may retreat.

---
\column
:: 
:: 
:: 
### Death & Dying
- **Death rolls occur at the start of the player turn**, not immediately at 0 HP.
- Some abilities **prevent instant death**, dropping HP to **1 instead of 0**.

---

### Speed & Movement
- Movement starts at **15 ft. at Level 1** and increases by **5 ft. per level**.
- Caps at **60 ft. at Level 10**.

---

### Enemy HP & Encounter Design
- Enemies have **high HP** to prevent one-turn kills.
- Alternative **Narrative Combat Rule**:  
  - The **GM decides** when an enemy dies, ensuring **each player has a cool moment** before the enemy falls.

# Spellcasting in Blood Bond

### The Nature of Magic
Magic in *Blood Bond* is a powerful and finite resource, deeply intertwined with the laws of alchemy and divine influence. Unlike weapons, spells cannot miss, but they require energy, concentration, and an **equivalent exchange** to be cast. Every spellcaster is born with a limited amount of **mana**, stored within their soul. When depleted, they must exchange physical objects to continue spellcasting.

### Equivalent Exchange
All magic comes at a price. Once a spellcaster has used all their personal mana, they must offer something of equal value to continue casting spells. The object sacrificed must match the spell’s power—small spells may only require trinkets, while more potent spells demand significant sacrifices.

---

### Spell Formula

**Damage = (Class Die x Spell Level) + Magical Affinity + Godly Blessing Percentage**

Each spell is linked to one of the **nine gods**, while characters themselves are linked to one of the **ten gods** (including the Sun). If a character casts a spell aligned with their god, they receive a **100% blessing bonus** (equal to their level). Spells from other gods receive only a fraction of this blessing.


{{note
#### Example Calculation
A Scholar (**d8** class die) with a **Magical Affinity of 7** at **Level 10**, casting a **Level 6 Moon spell**, linked to the **Moon Goddess**:

**Damage = (8 x 6) + 7 + 10 = 65**

If casting a **Level 3 Fire spell**, but linked to the Moon Goddess (not Fire), the damage calculation changes:

**Damage = (8 x 3) + 7 + (60% of 10) = 37**
}}

\column

### Elemental Weaknesses & Resistances

- **Weakness (1.5x Damage):** Creatures with elemental weaknesses take 150% damage.
- **Resistance (0.5x Damage):** Resistant creatures take half damage.
- **Immunity (0x Damage):** Immune creatures take no damage.
- **Neutral (1x Damage):** No damage adjustment.

---

### Bloodline Compatibility Table

Each godly bloodline has varying levels of effectiveness when casting spells from other elements. The following table displays these interactions:

| Bloodline      | Best (80%)           | Good (60%)           | Moderate (40%)       | Weak (20%)           | Neutral (50%)        |
| -------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Moon**       | Water, Love          | Love, Wind           | Protection, Earth    | Death, Fire          | Sun                  |
| **Water**      | Moon, Wind           | Earth, Song          | Love, Death          | Protection, Fire     | Sun                  |
| **Wind**       | Water, Earth         | Moon, Death          | Song, Fire           | Love, Protection     | Sun                  |
| **Earth**      | Wind, Death          | Water, Fire          | Moon, Protection     | Song, Love           | Sun                  |
| **Death**      | Earth, Fire          | Wind, Protection     | Love, Water          | Song, Moon           | Sun                  |
| **Fire**       | Protection, Death    | Love, Earth          | Wind, Song           | Water, Moon          | Sun                  |
| **Protection** | Fire, Love           | Song, Death          | Moon, Earth          | Water, Wind          | Sun                  |
| **Love**       | Protection, Song     | Fire, Moon           | Water, Death         | Wind, Earth          | Sun                  |
| **Song**       | Love, Moon           | Protection, Water    | Fire, Wind           | Death, Earth         | Sun                  |

# How Spells Are Spoken
Spells in *Blood Bond* use a structured incantation system based on **Effect, Element, Level, Duration, and Range**. Each spell component has an associated syllable, allowing for dynamic spell creation. By combining these components, spellcasters can create precise and versatile incantations, shaping magic to their will.
:: 

| Effect   | Syllable | Element    | Syllable | Level | Syllable | Duration | Syllable | Range | Syllable |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | ----- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ----- | -------- |
| Creation | Cre-     | Moon       | lu-      | 1     | un-      | Instant  | nun-     | Self  | uin.     |

# Spell Types & Compatibility
:: 

### Each spell belongs to one of the following domains:

- **Sun**: Universal force of life and magic. A jack-of-all-trades, but lacking mastery in any specific domain and has no spell affinity.
- **Moon, Earth, Wind, Water, Fire, Death, Love, Protect ion, Song**: These domains define spell effects and interactions.

Casters can use spells from any domain, but they will not receive full effectiveness unless they are aligned with that god.

---
:: 

## Advanced Spellcasting

### Particasts (Ambient Magic)
Some spells, called *Particasts*, draw from environmental magic rather than personal mana. These are generally weaker but do not consume mana or require equivalent exchange.

### Uncapped Spells (Oracle’s "The Fool")
Oracles may attempt **Uncapped Spells**, ignoring normal mana limits. However, these carry extreme risks: failure can deal backlash damage or disrupt the magic around them.
\column
::
### Notable Magic Specialties
- **Chronomages (Time Manipulation)**: Reverse time, speed up allies, and freeze enemies.
- **Graveturgy (Gravity Magic)**: Increase/decrease gravity, create singularities.
- **Illusionists (Deception Magic)**: Summon illusory clones, alter reality.
- **Sirens (Sound Magic)**: Inflict damage with sound waves, enhance allies.
- **Oracles (Fate Manipulation)**: Alter rolls, disrupt enemy actions, enhance ally survival.

---

## Spell Interactions & Counters

### Spell-Based Strategies

- **Anti-Mages** Can absorb/nullify spells.
- **Scholars** Alters spell effects to weaken enemy magic.
- **Performers** Can mock spells to nullify them.
- **Martial Artists** can counterattack magic physically.
- **War Mages** Can boost or suppress spell levels.

# Blood Bond TTRPG System

*The gods have marked you, the world will challenge you, and your choices will shape your fate. Blood Bond is a tabletop role-playing game where magic is raw and untamed, its power drawn from the very essence of the soul. Spells never miss, but every cast demands a price—drain your mana, sacrifice something of value, or risk the unknown. In a world where gods walk among mortals and the elements themselves can be harnessed, your destiny is yours to forge.*
:
*Power alone won’t save you. Blood Bond blends deep storytelling with tactical combat, where every battle is a test of wit, will, and skill. Strategy and teamwork are key, as even the strongest warrior can fall to a well-placed strike or a clever deception. With a rich world shaped by divine influence, shifting alliances, and the ever-present weight of consequence, every decision leaves a mark. How far will you go to carve your legend into history?*
